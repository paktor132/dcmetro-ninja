# DC Metro Ninja
DC Metro Ninja is a fork of the excellent MBTA Ninja app. MBTA Ninja is "Waze for the T": a crowdsourced alerting system for public transit in Boston. DC Metro is the same thing, but for DC. More features unique to the DC app may be added in the future.

The MBTA Ninja app started as a weekend hack by [David Lago](https://twitter.com/dave_lago), [Geoffrey Litt](https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [Radhika Malik](https://twitter.com/radhika1990) for [CodeAcross Boston 2015](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-boston-2015-tickets-15442437747).
The site is built using Meteor.js and Materialize.css, and deployed on Heroku.
